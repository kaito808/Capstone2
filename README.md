About this app:

This app is a US News Finder.
The purpose of this web app is for foreign stations to find news articles in the United States to report as international news.
For example, Japanese trains and buses have little monitors/tvs that show weather forecast, commercials and news. They like to show what is happening outside of Japan as 30 second international news.
This web app helps them to see a list of demanding news in the US both in English and Japanese so that it is easy for them to decide articles to pick.
